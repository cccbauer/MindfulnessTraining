# Noting Practice Study

## Overview

Welcome to the Noting Practice Instructions. This instructions were first used in - [Bauer et al 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112770) an delve into the concept of noting practice, a mindfulness technique where attention is directed in a gentle, non-effortful way towards whatever enters the field of consciousness. Unlike active concentration or deliberate analytical thinking, noting practice involves a passive observation of stimuli, whether they are sounds, sights, or sensations.


## Part 1: Understanding Noting Practice

### What is Noting Practice?

Noting practice is a form of mindfulness meditation that involves passively acknowledging whatever comes into your awareness without engaging in further analysis, judgment, or interpretation. For instance, if you hear the sound of a voice, you simply note "hearing" without trying to identify the speaker or the content of what is being said. This approach helps cultivate a state of open receptivity, allowing experiences to arise and pass without effort.

### The Instructions

Our instructioons are structured to guide participants through various exercises emphasizing the distinction between passive noting and active engagement. Through these exercises, we aim to investigate how individuals can cultivate and benefit from a noting practice in their daily lives.

## Getting Started

Interested in exploring noting practice or participating in our study? Here's how you can use it:

### Participation

- **Read Through the Instructions:** Begin by thoroughly reading the provided instructions. This ensures you understand the study's goals and what's expected from you as a participant.
- **Engage with the Exercises:** Follow the outlined steps for each exercise. The objective is to observe your natural responses and the quality of your awareness without forcing anything.
- **Share Your Experiences:** Participants are encouraged to share their experiences after completing the exercises. This could include observations about your state of awareness, the ease or difficulty of maintaining a noting practice, and any distinctions you noticed between active and passive engagement.

### Tools and Resources

- **Guided Audio Sessions:** Some exercises include audio rrecordings of stories to help facilitate your noting practice in daily life.
- **Checklist Forms:** Exoperimenters will have access to forms to document and share the trining progress.
